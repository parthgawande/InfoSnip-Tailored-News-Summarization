## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

InfoSnip utilizes both **extractive** and **abstractive** summarization techniques:

### Extractive Summarization:
- Extracts key sentences directly from the article.
- **Models used**: 
  - **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for deep contextual understanding.
  - **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to highlight word importance and select informative sentences.

### Abstractive Summarization:
- Generates new sentences that capture the essence of the original article.
- **Models used**:
  - **T5** (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) for paraphrasing the article content.
  - **BART** (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) to reconstruct masked text inputs and generate concise summaries.

## üß™ Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using:
- **ROUGE Score** (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): Measures the overlap between model-generated summaries and reference summaries.
  - **ROUGE-1**: For unigrams.
  - **ROUGE-2**: For bigrams.
- **Readability**: BART and T5 excel in producing understandable text, with BART slightly outperforming T5.
- **Lexical Diversity**: BART demonstrates a broader vocabulary, resulting in vibrant summaries.
- **Semantic Similarity**: TF-IDF excels in capturing the factual essence and long-range dependencies of the article.

## üî• Comparative Analysis

- **BART**: Delivers the best balance of readability and factual accuracy, making it ideal for a wide range of article categories.
- **TF-IDF**: Performs well in extractive summarization, especially for retaining long-range dependencies from the original content.
- **GPT-4**: Provides real-time, high-quality summaries comparable to BART in both performance and precision.
